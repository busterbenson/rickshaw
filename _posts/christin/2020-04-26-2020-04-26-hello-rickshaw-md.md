## Hello Rickshaw World!

I am writing to test my ability to post here. Isn't troubleshooting half the fun of making a website? I think that's what a lot of social media pre-built tools lack these days--they work almost _too_ well. Nothing like the wild wild west of pure HTML (uh well, Markdown and Ruby.) Yet static websites like these remain the most accessible to those with limited bandwidth.
