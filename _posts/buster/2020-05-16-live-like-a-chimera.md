### This is a draft. Unresolved questions include: 

- @delightfuljon: What is the 150 word version?
- @miri: I wonder where chaos plays into this.
- Is this mutually exclusive and collectively exhautive as a framework?
- Does it pass its own test?
- What form should it take in terms of expression?
- I haven't explained the Chimera part of the title yet at all. 

### Basic intro

I'm testing out (via daily writing, and occasional conversations) a mythic pattern language that has these 3 primary categories: 

1. ‚ù§Ô∏è **deepening dialogues with our intuitions** -- the subconscious / identities / value systems / belief systems / preferences. (aka Red / Cat / Heart / Self / Home / Paper)
2. üß† **deepening dialogues with the universe** -- reality / truth / material evidence / verifiable information. (aka Blue / Raven / Head / World / Public / Scissors)
3. ‚úã **deepening dialogues with community** -- systems / social contracts / cultural norms / interdependence. (aka Green / Turtle / Hands / Community / Frontier / Rock)

I don't want to make everything fit into these categories, which is why I like the color system's ability to blend. 

For example, if a personal interest like cooking feels like it has elements of all three (pure enjoyment of food = red, understanding the chemistry of cooking = blue, breaking bread with others = green) then it is iridescent / white. Private journaling is mostly in the red category, unless we participate in a private journaling community (green)... so that one is red+green=yellow. 

My biggest question right now is whether these three categories are [mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MECE_principle) enough to not introduce blind spots (aka infrared and ultraviolent light, as well as color-blindness). Of course, that question is a non-terminating question so I haven't been able to know when I've tested enough possibilities to move on. 

Assuming I can do that, the next biggest question is whether the system can make these categories more valuable, evidence-based, and socially valuable in the language that it is. Is it important, true, and useful -- aka iridescent?

And THEN the question is... what form should it take in terms of expression? (HINT: these notes are not it.)

An unspoken assumption I have for myself is that this needs to be de-nerdified very significantly. I want to have done all of this work and thought and then package it like a Snickers bar that anyone can enjoy.

And this is what I think @kev_mcg and @splangster and others talking about pattern languages and homes and spaces excels. Ultimately this is enjoyable if I can use it to organize my bedside table, the side porch, my kitchen, my desk, my bathroom, etc.


### Why is this important? Is it true? Is it useful?

Where do I go to dialogue with myself, and what do I do there? I have a growing list of notes about this. My basement. My morning shower. My headphones with music on a walk. If I look at these places and times and contexts, could this pattern language give me tools to make these accidental rituals more effective?

Where do I go to dialogue with the world? I realized I often look out the window near my kitchen to the sky and to squirrels walking on power lines when I need more connection to objective reality. This is a neglected area for me, though... and I have recently started studying moon phases and solstices and equinoxes to have better hand holds in terms of dialoguing with the universe. 

Where do I go to dialogue with community and systems? Here, for one. Also, the table in my kitchen, and the living room, and the sitting area in my backyard. Being a guest on podcasts also qualifies. Work in the past has qualified. I have a default preference for very small groups over large, but am beginning to wonder if those defaults have room to grow and expand.
In all three cases I see very low hanging fruit to change the spaces, the times, the beliefs, and the expectations about these accidental rituals. It's easy for me to see how they could be improved, given more vibrant life, and turned into quiet, but powerful, mini rituals and celebrations of the sacred within the mundane.

### Where is the chaos monkey?

I currently don't think of chaos as having a voice. It is a hidden part of the subconscious, the world, and the community that represents miscommunication or lack of communication. It's just the shadow of those things that we don't have any dialogue with. But, we should at the very least have a way of talking about the chaos monkey and the dark forest (and the ouroboros and the bewilderbeasts and the chimera).

### High level outline

There are 8 modes that capture all possible relationships between the self and the subconscious, the world, and the community: 

1. Opaque / Black: no dialogue with all three
2. Red: dialogue with our intuitions but not the other two
3. Blue: dialogue with the world but not the other two
4. Green: dialogue with community but not the other two
5. Magenta: dialogue with our intuitions and the world but not community
6. Cyan: dialogue with the world and community but not our intuitions
7. Yellow: dialogue with our intuitions and commuity but not the world
8. Iridescent / White: dialogue open with all three

My old [Live Like a Hydra](https://medium.com/better-humans/live-like-a-hydra-c02337782a89) post maps pretty well to this, with only a couple gaps: 

1. Recovery mode = opaque / black
2. Novelty mode = blue
3. Word mode = green
4. Self mode = red
5. Flow mode = cyan and magenta combined
6. People mode = yellow and some cyan
7. Gold mode = iridescent / white
