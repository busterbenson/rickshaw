### This is a draft. Unresolved questions include: 

- @delightfuljon: What is the 150 word version?
- @miri: I wonder where chaos plays into this.
- Is this mutually exclusive and collectively exhautive as a framework?
- Does it pass its own test of being important, real, and useful?
- What form should it take in terms of expression?
- I haven't explained the Chimera part of the title yet at all. 

### In 150 words...

TBD

### Theory-heavy intro

I'm testing out (via daily writing, and occasional conversations) a "mythic pattern language" that has these 3 foundational categories of practice: 

1. ‚ù§Ô∏èü¶ûüè° **RED: Deepening dialogues with our Intuitions**
	- About finding the center of our own internal world via the experience of sensing and being.
	- Core question: What is important?
	- Dark Forest conundrum: meaninglessness
	- Connected mode: acceptance, integrity, authenticity, normalizing
	- Disconnected mode: anxiety, lost soul, numb to everything, cynical
	- Synonyms for Intuition: the subconscious, our identities, value systems, belief systems, preferences, story-telling, being mode. 
	- Symbols: Red, Cat, Heart, Self, Home, Paper
2. üß†ü¶ãüåé **BLUE: Deepening dialogues with the Universe**:
	- About extending our map of the known universe and making more of it feel relevant to us.
	- Core question: What is real?
	- Dark Forest conundrum: too much information
	- Connected mode: curiosity, intellectual honesty, wondering, observing
	- Disconnected mode: absurdity, all is nonsense / bullshit / fake
	- Synonyms for Universe: reality, truth, material evidence, verifiable information, science, having mode. 
	- Symbols: Blu, Raven, Head, World, Public, Scissors
3. ‚úãüêâüå≥ **GREEN: Deepening dialogues with Community**:
	- About noticing the interdependent dynamics playing between everything, working within the messiness of communication, feedback loops, and the multiple-order effects. It‚Äôs about doing things and then seeing what happens.	
	- Core question: What is useful?
	- Dark Forest conundrum: time and resource constraints 
	- Connected mode: playfulness, humor, courage, participating
	- Disconnected mode: feeling alienated, not belonging, being invisible
	- Synonyms for Community: systems, social contracts, cultural norms, interdependence, strategy, doing mode.
	- Symbols: Green, Turtle, Hands, Community, Frontier, Rock

### What is a foundational category?

A metaphor will help here I think, maybe. Let's try some color and light theory. As you know, there is a very wide spectrum of electromagetic waves, and we're able to perceive a certain subset of the spectrum with 3 cones in our eyes (okay, sometimes 4, though we'll discard that for the purposes of this metaphor). The 3 cones are sensitive to different wavelengths of light that correspond roughly to red, green, and blue (again, not perfectly, I know) and with these 3 cones we perceive millions of different colors that are the building blocks that give us a visible spectrum of light. This interplay between electromagnetic waves and our eyeball cones allow our brains to see things in the world and make sense of them. There's nothing intrinsic to the universe that gives the specific wavelengths of color we see meaning, and yet we still find the act of vision meaningful. 

I'm proposing here that we have developed 3 fundamental ways for constructing an infinite variety of personal, purposeful, meaning in our lives from the full spectrum of possible experience (most of which we'll never witness directly). There is no intrinsic meaning to experience built in, but we've developed three ways to feel connected and meaningful within it by having conversations that take us deeper into the experience of our intuitions (RED), our experience of external reality (BLUE), and our experience of community and systems (GREEN). While they allow us to create meaning from our experiences, they aren't discovering something that exists separately from our experience of it, like a divine truth, for example. It's closer to the kind of meaning we derive from growth... the act of growing, of both integrating something new and shedding something old, that feels like a cool breeze of a meaningful existence.

### What is a core question?

In the 

### What is a Dark Forest conundrum?

### What do the Connected and Disconnected modes refer to?

### What are the synonyms and symbols about? 

### Potential risks and blind spots of this framework

I don't want to make everything fit into these categories in a forced way, nor enforce things to only be in one category. That's part of why I like the color system's ability to blend in an intuitive way. 

For example, if a personal interest like cooking feels like it has elements of all three (pure enjoyment of food = red, understanding the chemistry of cooking = blue, breaking bread with others = green) then the act of cooking in this instance is iridescent / white. Private journaling is mostly in the red category, unless we participate in a private journaling community (green)... so that one is red+green=yellow (using the light/additive color model). Of course, cooking and journaling can both also be unenjoyable, dismissive of chemistry, and disconnected from community... the acts themselves don't have color intrinsically, but they gain color through the interplay of self, the world, and community. 

My biggest question right now is whether these three categories are [mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MECE_principle) enough to not introduce blind spots (aka infrared and ultraviolent light, as well as color-blindness). Of course, that question is a non-terminating one so I haven't been able to know when I've tested enough possibilities to move on. 

Assuming I can do that, the next biggest question is whether the system can make these categories more valuable, evidence-based, and socially valuable in the language that it is. Is the framework itself important, true, and useful -- aka iridescent? 

And THEN the question is... what form should it take in terms of expression? (HINT: these notes are not it.)

An unspoken assumption I have for myself is that this needs to be de-nerdified quite a bit. I want to have done all of this work and thought and then package it like a Snickers bar that anyone can enjoy. 

And this is what I think @kev_mcg and @splangster and others talking about pattern languages and homes and spaces excels. Ultimately this is enjoyable if I can use it to better relate to my bedside table, the side porch, my kitchen, my desk, my bathroom, my workplace, my relationships, my internal monologue, and my calendar.

**Where do I go to dialogue with myself, and what do I do there?** I have a growing list of notes about this. My basement. My morning shower. My headphones with music on a walk. If I look at these places and times and contexts, could this pattern language give me tools to make these accidental rituals more effective?

**Where do I go to dialogue with the world?** I realized I often look out the window near my kitchen to the sky and to squirrels walking on power lines when I need more connection to objective reality. This is a neglected area for me, though... and I have recently started studying moon phases and solstices and equinoxes to have better hand holds in terms of dialoguing with the universe. 

**Where do I go to dialogue with community and systems?** Here, for one. Also, the table in my kitchen, and the living room, and the sitting area in my backyard. Being a guest on podcasts also qualifies. Work in the past has qualified. I have a default preference for very small groups over large, but am beginning to wonder if those defaults have room to grow and expand.

**The opportunity:** In all three cases I see very low hanging fruit to change the spaces, the times, the beliefs, and the expectations about these accidental rituals. It's easy for me to see how they could be improved, given more vibrant life, and turned into quiet, but powerful, mini rituals and celebrations of the sacred within the mundane.

### High level outline

There are 8 modes that capture all possible relationships between the self and the subconscious, the world, and the community: 

1. Opaque / Black: no dialogue with all three
2. Red: dialogue with our intuitions but not the other two
3. Blue: dialogue with the world but not the other two
4. Green: dialogue with community but not the other two
5. Magenta: dialogue with our intuitions and the world but not community
6. Cyan: dialogue with the world and community but not our intuitions
7. Yellow: dialogue with our intuitions and commuity but not the world
8. Iridescent / White: dialogue open with all three

My old [Live Like a Hydra](https://medium.com/better-humans/live-like-a-hydra-c02337782a89) post maps pretty well to this, with only a couple gaps: 

1. Recovery mode = opaque / black
2. Novelty mode = blue
3. Word mode = green
4. Self mode = red
5. Flow mode = cyan and magenta combined
6. People mode = yellow and some cyan
7. Gold mode = iridescent / white

I see this color / chimera system as being a bit more precise and useful specifically when talking about the Flow and People modes of the Hydra framework. Or rather it's a bit more "mutually exclusive" even though they are both equally exhaustive.

### What is the Chimera reference to?

TBD

### The test: Is it important? Is it true? Is it useful?

TBD

### Is this too orderly? What about the chaos monkey?

I currently don't think of chaos as having a voice. It is a hidden part of the subconscious, the world, and the community that represents miscommunication or lack of communication. It's just the shadow of those things that we don't have any dialogue with. But, we should at the very least have a way of talking about the chaos monkey and the dark forest (and the ouroboros and the bewilderbeasts and the chimera).
