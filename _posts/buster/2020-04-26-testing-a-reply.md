What is the best workflow that would allow us to reply to each others' posts here? I'm trying to think of the simplest possible set of steps. For example, grabbing the URL of the post you want to reply to and adding it to the front matter of a new post, like `replying_to: https://busterbenson.github.io/rickshaw/kev_mcg/2020-04-25-potential-patterns-for-shared-websites`. Still pretty janky, but on the upside we could completely customize the reading experience to be whatever we thought was the best experience. Testing out a Github issue as a commenting system also cause why not?
