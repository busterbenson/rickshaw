Rickshaw is like a website for a community of friends. It uses the simplest and most reliable forms of internet technology to create a shared space on the internet that is simple and infused with trust and good will. If you want to join, [DM me on Twitter](http://twitter.com/buster) or some other way.

Anyone that wants to build their own website for a community can fork this website for free and start their own. You need to know a bit about how to use Github, but it doesn't require any super fancy technical knowledge. 

The steps you could take are:
1. Create a free [Github](http://github.com) account.
2. Fork this repo: [busterbenson/rickshaw](https://github.com/busterbenson/rickshaw).
3. Download the repo to your computer and edit `_config.yml` to give it your own name.
4. Edit the `_data/people.yml` file to include people you want in your community.
5. Take a look at the content in the `_posts` and `_pages` directories and either edit them or delete them. 
6. When you're ready, commit the files and turn on the Github Pages flag in Github's settings.
7. Go to `github.com/[your_username]/rickshaw` to see your brand new website.
8. Poke around and change things.
9. Feel free to ask questions about how to do this on my [issues](https://github.com/busterbenson/rickshaw/issues/new) page.
