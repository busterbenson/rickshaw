## Practicum: Building a Personal Mythology of Sacred Spaces at Home Through Ritual and Research

Archaeology of Homeplaces – approaching building tasks with an ear to the ground and an eye to the past

-	Who lived here?
-	What did they do here? 
-	What did they mean by … ?
-	What can we learn from their choices and practices?
-	How can we feel connected to this home through the past?
-	How can we recognize that this building and its land had a life before us?
-	What are we doing now that is a repetition of an old ritual?
-	How can we feel peace through reconciliation of past hurts?
-	How can we honor the history of this space?
-	How can we understand the place this home has in its environment?


Connecting the past to our future:

-	We are stewards
-	We are guardians
-	We are children of history
-	We are curators
-	We are docents
-	We are evangelists
-	We are matchmakers
 
Clearing the property lines. Layers of history. Wild Irish Rose per linear foot. A privet hedge. Ivy. A barbed-wire fence. On trees that are planted vs those that spring up in a place of neglect.

Mr. Wright and the fig tree – a long-neglected fig had grown until it’s branches covered almost 60 feet across. We were cutting it down when Mr. Wright – in his 90’s – came over and stood at the edge of the yard. He told us he remembered it being planted when he was a young man. We decided to cut it back severely instead. We started a cutting from it and gave him a baby tree. The tree was technically our property, but in a sense it also belonged to the collective memory of the block.

Brian: “I’d forgotten this house was here.” On how the largest house on the block was invisible to residents and how that feels.
Bonnie: “Ms. Way lived in this room, and Juanita here.” On how places within a house always belong to the people who have lived in them as long as someone remembers them living there.
“My brother used to stay here.” Susan: A tree fell through the roof. It was filled with mold. People were passed out in the yard. 
“She was so proud of her yard.

The things we’ve found:
-	Bulbs that spring up seemingly in the middle of nowhere – it was the edge of a…garage?
-	The cement block and brick edges of a garden plot.
-	Spigots in the middle of the yard.
-	A pipe growing in the middle of a tree trunk
-	A clothesline T cemented deep into the ground.
-	Tools in the dirt.
