## Practicum: Building a Personal Mythology of Sacred Spaces at Home Through Ritual and Research

This post is a response to Buster's Foolish Journey post [Why We Should Create Personal Mythologies](https://medium.com/foolish-journey/why-we-should-create-personal-mythologies-and-how-69333b1d5e2b) as well as Kevin's follow-up, [A Mythic Pattern Language](https://medium.com/foolish-journey/a-mythic-pattern-language-de46a8e7b9e). 

If _we've lost the language to talk about myth_ and getting into mythic mode involves viewing the world through a storylike lens in order to build a bridge back to that lost land, can developing a story language around the sacred spaces of home help us feel more solidly rooted in a place from which to launch that campaign? I have been thinking about this as a sort of _Archaeology of Homeplaces_ – for which I have crafted a catchy tagline: _approaching building tasks with an ear to the ground and an eye to the past._

I am interested in these questions because I have a house. When I got the house, I wanted it to be my home. The approach I have taken has strayed into the mythical, from considering the property not as a thing, but as a part of my family, with it's own experiences of history. So the process began with asking questions and listening for an answer. Some of the questions were things like this:

-	Who lived here?
-	What did they do here? 
-	What did they mean by … ?
-	What can we learn from their choices and practices?
-	How can we feel connected to this home through the past?
-	How can we recognize that this building and its land had a life before us?
-	What are we doing now that is a repetition of an old ritual?
-	How can we feel peace through reconciliation of past hurts?
-	How can we honor the history of this space?
-	How can we understand the place this home has in its environment?

###The first story: House of Pain

In 2015, when I first encountered this property - her name is Quercus, for the majestic oak that overlooks the house - it took a little effort to notice the charm. The view from the street is captured in a google drive-by image:

As we began to clean up the fenceline in those first days, before we'd even moved a box over, an elder of the block walked by on one of his many daily trips to the corner store and said "I'd forgotten this house was here." This, a 2700 square foot, two story house on a double lot, in a short block of only 16 houses. Invisible to the block's own residents. As I considered the cognitive feat involved in blocking out an eyesore such as this, I thought about how entire neighborhoods and groups of people are routinely made invisible by our refusal to look at them. I thought about it even more when B- told us that his brother had once lived in the house, when it was a boarding house.

The fenceline was no joke. Over the years it had grown into a fifteen-foot-wide tangle of the original planted privet hedge, english ivy, poison ivy, and small offspring of the oaks. Any effort to dig would uncover tools, needles, knives, guns, and hundreds of bottles once filled with Wild Irish Rose, a rotgut wine product sold at area c-stores.

This detritus told painful stories about who'd been living on Quercus, which were supplemented by details from the next door neighbor, who described it a sort of unofficial halfway house, with residents living inside the home as well as many who set up camp in the darkness of the surrounding overgrowth. This use was terminated only when a tree branch fell through the roof and went unrepaired until the place was unliveable.



Connecting the past to our future:

-	We are stewards
-	We are guardians
-	We are children of history
-	We are curators
-	We are docents
-	We are evangelists
-	We are matchmakers
 
Why do I care? "We were here." Wanting to be important enough to be remembered? Legacy? Is remembering others the kind of recitation that we hope will take place for us? On ephemerality - if this was once a farm, what might it be in the future? Might the whole neighborhood be replaced and forgotten in another 100 years? What evidence will be available? Why does it matter? On permanence - if I can unearth a tool and imagine someone working in the barn that stood here, am I rooted more deeply in this space? Am I encouraged that someone will stand before my towering camelia hedge and imagine me planting these fragile twigs?

Clearing the property lines. Layers of history. Wild Irish Rose per linear foot. A privet hedge. Ivy. A barbed-wire fence. 

On trees that are planted vs those that spring up in a place of neglect.

Mr. Wright and the fig tree – a long-neglected fig had grown until it’s branches covered almost 60 feet across. We were cutting it down when Mr. Wright – in his 90’s – came over and stood at the edge of the yard. He told us he remembered it being planted when he was a young man. We decided to cut it back severely instead. We started a cutting from it and gave him a baby tree. The tree was technically our property, but in a sense it also belonged to the collective memory of the block.


Bonnie: “Ms. Way lived in this room, and Juanita here.” On how places within a house always belong to the people who have lived in them as long as someone remembers them living there.
“My brother used to stay here.” Susan: A tree fell through the roof. It was filled with mold. People were passed out in the yard. 
“She was so proud of her yard.

The things we’ve found:
-	Bulbs that spring up seemingly in the middle of nowhere – it was the edge of a…garage?
-	The cement block and brick edges of a garden plot.
-	Spigots in the middle of the yard.
-	A pipe growing in the middle of a tree trunk
-	A clothesline T cemented deep into the ground.
-	Tools in the dirt.
