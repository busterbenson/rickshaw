## A New Post

_If you have ten minutes, you can learn Markdown!_

##I am learning to use a minimal amount of Markdown language

I used a [tutorial](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/) and in Lesson 3 I made a link. **And bold**

For a few minutes, I was thinking _this is dumb_, especially since I'm pretty sure I knew all this stuff at some point in the past, and I'll probably just forget again. And even after the tutorial, I don't think I understand what reference links are, even though they sound useful.

![this is me rolling my eyes](https://sdk.bitmoji.com/render/panel/6daef78d-7134-458c-8606-98e921b3feb7-2dfdbeda-c279-46d2-b944-af7747013d21-v1.png?transparent=1&palette=1)

But then I remembered this inspirational Ben Franklin thing I am going to put in a blockquote:

>Tell me and I forget. Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I learn.

I've made it all the way to lesson 6, and just about to the end of my patience, because it'a already taken far more than the ten minutes promised and I'm not even finished, but _before I quit_, here is a **list of the things I've learned:**

* hashtags for headlines
* underlines for italics
* two asterisks for bold
* brackets and parens for links
* add an exclamation mark for an image
* reference link and image something something
* greater than for a blockquote
* asterisk and on it's own line for a bullet list
* maybe something else but I already forgot

Over and out. 

Oh, also, I learned last night that when I finish this document: 
* click the floppy disk because no autosave
* commit to the savingness before losing interest
