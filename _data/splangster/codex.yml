categories:

### BELIEFS BY CATEGORY
# Each section needs to start with a string like "example-category" (letters and dashes
# only, no spaces, and there needs to be a colon at the end). 
# Then there's a name. Then there's "beliefs:" on a line by itself. That's because 
# the section that comes after will be a list of beliefs, each of which starts with 
# four spaces, a "- desc: " and text. The two lines below it for confidence and 
# last_updated are optional, you can leave them out, or keep them in.
