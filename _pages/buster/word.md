DRAFT

"Amateur" is my Word for my 44th orbit.

## Summary
The word amateur comes from the Latin word `amare` which means "to love". The French coined the word in the 18th century to mean:

> "One who cultivates and participates in something but does not pursue it professionally or with an eye to gain." -- [Online Etymology Dictionary](https://www.etymonline.com/word/amateur)

It can be used both aspirationally and in a disparaging manner. The amateur is the foil to the professional, the expert, the authority, which also have both positive and negative connotations. There are many strong cases made for [the expert](https://fs.blog/2017/08/amateurs-professionals/) over the amateur, and there are many circumstances where I agree with these cases. It's tough to argue that expertise plays a valuable role in today's world with so many complex problems. 

What good is an amateur, then? Experts are useful when the domains of knowledge, wisdom, and craft needed to thrive in a given situation are all well-understood. They are less useful when the chaotic nature of reality reveals a new crucial domain of expertise that hasn't yet been reckoned with. Experts of other fields may swoop in, steeped in Dunning-Kruger effect, and attempt to co-opt their expertise in the other domain for one that also applies here. Sometimes that works, other times it makes things worse. The amateur can enter the domain with a desire to see and understand the new landscape with a beginner's eyes, and clear a path for understanding to build up again, from the ground up. 

The case for the amateur is one that looks at our current world and recognizes many crucial domains of understanding that haven't been reckoned with yet, and actively searches for them out of love, and not necessarily in order to gain personally or professionally from them.

## Backstory
Every year I come up with a motto for the year. Last year's was "All in and with the flow". This year, I participated in [Dr. Jason Fox](https://www.drjasonfox.com/)'s [Choose One Word](https://www.cleverness.com/word) programme and believe that this is just the enhancement my yearly motto needed to carry me into the 15th year of self-reflective birthdays. Past years include: 

1. [43: All in & with the flow](https://busterbenson.com/blog/2019/05-31-all-in-and-with-the-flow/)

13. [31: Double down](https://busterbenson.com/blog/2007/05-29-double-down/)
14. [30: Higher highs and lower lows](https://busterbenson.com/blog/2006/05-31-higher-highs-lower-lows/)

As I get older, a few things seem to be happening. One: I've accrued a toolbox of "things that seem to work" that become increasingly salient to me whenever a new problem appears before me. Two: When I look back on how well "the way I did things successfully before" actually do when applied to the new challenges, I'm not seeing a very strong correlation. Things that worked in my career the first two decades of my professional life (whether it be as an entrepreneur, product leader, or writer) don't necessarily work when I try to apply them to my current professional life. Same goes for things that worked in the first 10 years of my marriage, and the first 9, or 3, years of parenting. Things that worked in politics, and consumption of information, and maintaining health, etc also seem to be failing more often than not. Too much chaos has been injected into the system, and a second wave of problems caused by our refusal to try new approaches is added on as an aftershock to the chaos. The pandemic's chaotic move on reality has turned us all into beginners. 

It feels like a good time to leave our expertise at the door (unless you're a doctor, essential worker, care-taker, etc... those domains remain relatively stable in terms of how to function effectively).

Beyond that... bring in the amateurs, I say!

## Principles
1. **Savor Mistakes.** Let mistakes linger instead of being immediately erased. Let them be a teacher.
2. **Indulge Distractions.** Always make space and time for quiet, undirected interests to blossom. Instead of stomping down the trail of progress, keep an ear open for that unexpected bird call, and then stop and shhh to see if you can hear it again. Consider a new trail that gets you closer to the unexpected bird.
3. **Embody Foolishness.** Embark on foolish journeys. The professionals and experts have clouded our eyes about which journeys are worthwhile and which aren't, and there are probably good things hidden on trails that have been marked as too foolish to walk down. 

## Patterns
* Doodle without a goal. 
* Plink on the piano. 
* Whittle on many small projects.
* Have fun reading Tarot and other symbol languages.
* Make imperfect meals.
* Launch impossible projects. 
* Leave projects unfinished.
* Give things away without thought. 
* Publish first drafts. 
* Wandering through multiple realms.
* Invite disagreement. 

## Projects
* Rickshaw
* 750 Words
* Poetry
* Gardens

## Associations
* **The Pages and Princesses of Tarot** The youngest of the court cards, the Page (or Princess, depending on the deck) of Cups, Wands, Swords, and Coins are typically known as the enthusiastic novices of their suit. They lack the caution and the mastery that the other court carts grow to represent. 
* **Mudskippers** Long-term amateurs of life on land.  

## How You Can Help
I will pay you $1 (or add it to a pool that gets donated to a good cause) if you catch me doing anything that I am doing in order to appear professional or as an expert in a way that it is clear that I do not intrinsically love doing that thing directly.
