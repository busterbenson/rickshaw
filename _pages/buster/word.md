DRAFT

"Amateur" is my Word for my 44th orbit.

## Summary
The amateur is the foil to the professional, the expert, the pundit.

## Backstory
Every year I come up with a motto for the year. Last year's was "All in and with the flow". This year, I participated in Dr. Jason Fox's "Choose One Word" programme and believe that this is just the enhancement my yearly motto needed to carry me into the 15th year of self-reflective birthdays.

## Principles
1. **Savor Mistakes.** Let mistakes linger instead of being immediately erased. Let them be a teacher.
2. **Indulge Distractions.** Always make space and time for quiet, undirected interests to blossom. Instead of stomping down the trail of progress, keep an ear open for that unexpected bird call, and then stop and shhh to see if you can hear it again. Consider a new trail that gets you closer to the unexpected bird.
3. **Embody Foolishness.** Embark on foolish journeys. The professionals and experts have clouded our eyes about which journeys are worthwhile and which aren't, and there are probably good things hidden on trails that have been marked as too foolish to walk down. 

## Patterns
* Doodle without a goal. 
* Plink on the piano. 
* Whittle on many small projects.
* Have fun reading Tarot and other symbol languages.
* Make imperfect meals.
* Launch impossible projects. 
* Leave projects unfinished.
* Give things away without thought. 
* Publish first drafts. 
* Wandering through multiple realms.
* Invite disagreement. 

## Projects
* Rickshaw
* 750 Words
* Poetry
* Gardens

## Associations
* **The Pages and Princesses of Tarot** The youngest of the court cards, the Page (or Princess, depending on the deck) of Cups, Wands, Swords, and Coins are typically known as the enthusiastic novices of their suit. They lack the caution and the mastery that the other court carts grow to represent. 
* **Mudskippers** Long-term amateurs of life on land.  

## How You Can Help
I will pay you $1 (or add it to a pool that gets donated to a good cause) if you catch me doing anything that I am doing in order to appear professional or as an expert in a way that it is clear that I do not intrinsically love doing that thing directly.
